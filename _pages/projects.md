## Facial recognition system using convolutional neural network <br>(_July 2017_)
`python` `open-cv` `keras` `VGG-16 Net` `MatConvNet`<br>
* This project was part of my internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India. 
* I have used the VGG-16 Net architecture and this has been implemented using keras library in python.
* Implementation done based on the approach suggested in this [paper](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf).
* Detailed note of methodology followed is presented in the [**_Project blog_**](https://anirudhk686.github.io/facial_recognition/).<br>[[_Source code_]](https://github.com/anirudhk686/facial_recognition)

## Antarctic weather data analysis using ARIMA model <br>(_June 2017_)
`python` `Jupyter-notebook` `statsmodel` `matplotlib`<br>
* This project was also part of my internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India.
* After priliminary analysis, modeled temperature data with the Seasonal ARIMA model. Forecast was also done based on the obtained model.
* Wind speed analysis was done. Here main objective was to find out the monthly blizzard distribution.
* Detailed note of methodology followed is described in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/anirudhk686/weather_data_analysis/blob/master/Final_report.pdf).<br>

## Stock market simulation - _A trading simulator_ <br>(_Dec 2016 - Feb 2017_)
`python` `django` `ajax`<br>
* This project was made for an event in APOGEE,our technical fest. More than 300 participants from all over the country participated in this event.
* This project was used as trading platform in an event which was simulation of the stock market.Participants could register and trade with their mobile.
* Server was hosted on college LAN.The event had four rounds and stock prices would change as per the trading in previous round.
* Videos were shown in between the rounds which simulated an event that would influence the market.<br>
