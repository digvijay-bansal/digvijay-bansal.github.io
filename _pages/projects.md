## Simulation of Electrolytes and FDSOI ISFETs on Conventional TCAD Simulators <br>(_Aug 2017_)
`Silvaco` `Sentaurus` `MATLAB`<br>
Guide: [**Dr. Soumendu Sinha, CSIR-CEERI Pilani**](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/soumendu-sinha) and [**Prof. Dr. VK Chaubey, BITS Pilani**](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/vkc/profile).
+ Developing techniques for modelling of electrolytes used in ISFETs as semiconductors to obtain I-V Characteristics.
+ Performing Permittivity Variation Analysis at the sensing layer, i.e. Semiconductor-Electrolyte Interface of ISFETs.
+ Analyzing the Back Gate Effects on FDSOI ISFETs as various device parameters are varied, i.e box-length, channel-length etc.<br>

## Design, Analysis and Implementation of Neuromorphic Signals<br>(_Jan 2018_)
`SPECTRE` `SPICE` `MATLAB`<br>
Guide: [**Prof. Dr. Anu Gupta, BITS Pilani**](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/anug/Profile).
+ Developing techniques for modelling of electrolytes used in ISFETs as semiconductors to obtain I-V Characteristics.<br>

## Analog and Digital VLSI Circuit Design<br>(_Aug 2017_)
`Verilog` `Cadence Virtuoso` `SPICE` `ModelSim` `Microwind`<br>
+ This project was a part of my Academic Curriculum, BITS EEE-313 Analog and Digital VLSI Design.
+ Power and delay optimized, Design of an 8:1 multiplexer using Transmission Gate logic style in Cadence Virtuoso.
+ Implementation of the non-restoring algorithm for dividing a six-bit number by three-bit number in VHDL.
+ Design of three-stage CMOS Operational Amplifier for given parameters i.e. unity gain bandwidth, gain, phase margin and slew rate.<br>

## Gender Detection using Digital Signal Processing<br>(_Aug 2017_)
`MATLAB`<br>
+ This project was a part of my Academic Curriculum, BITS EEE-434 Digital Signal Processing.
+ Implemented the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm on the recorded voice signal to determine the fundamental frequency.
+ Observed the effect on the fundamental frequency when white Gaussian noise is added to the recorded signal at a suitably low and high values of SNRs.<br>
