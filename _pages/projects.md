## Analysis of Electronic Equipments used in Maintenance of Power Generatorsâ€™ <br>(_July 2017_)
<br>
* This project was part of my Summer Internship at [Adani Power Training and Reseach Institute](http://www.aptri.org/), Gujarat, India. 
* At Adani Power, I worked in Maintenance and Testing Division under the Guidance of Mr. Ajit Kumar.
* I gained an extensive hands-on experience in Industrial Standard Testing process and methodologies followed during Overhauling of Power Generation Units.
* I worked on exploring possibilties to reduce losses during the maintainence of Power Generators by analyzing operation data of several years.
* Detailed report of analysis is presented in the [**_Project Report_**](https://github.com/digvijay-bansal/Maintainence-and-Overhauling-of-Generators-)


## Simulation of Electrolytes and FDSOI ISFETs on Conventional TCAD Simulators <br>(_Aug 2017_)
`Silvaco` `Sentaurus` `MATLAB`<br>
* Currently, working under the guidance of [**Dr. Soumendu Sinha, CSIR-CEERI Pilani**](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/soumendu-sinha), and [**Prof. Dr. VK Chaubey, BITS Pilani**](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/vkc/profile), .
* Developing techniques for modelling of electrolytes used in ISFETs as semiconductors to obtain I-V Characteristics.
* Performing Permittivity Variation Analysis at the sensing layer, Semiconductor-Electrolyte Interface of ISFETs.
* Analyzing the Back Gate Effects on FDSOI ISFETs as various device parameters are varied, i.e box-length, channel-length etc.
* Detailed note of methodology followed is described in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/digvijay-bansal/Simulation-of-FDSOI-ISFETS).

## Analog and Digital VLSI Circuit Design<br>(_Aug 2017_)
`Verilog` `Cadence Virtuoso` `ModelSim` `Microwind`<br>
* This project was a part of my Academic Curriculum, BITS EEE-313 Analog and Digital VLSI Design.
* Power and delay optimized, Design of an 8:1 multiplexer using Transmission Gate logic style in Cadence Virtuoso.
* Implementation of the non-restoring algorithm for dividing a six-bit number by three-bit number in VHDL.
* Design of CMOS Operational Amplifier for given parameters i.e. bandwidth, gain and phase margin.<br>
* Detailed report of project is presented in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/digvijay-bansal/ADVD-Project/blob/master/ADVD%20Digital%20Assignment.pdf).

## Gender Detection using Digital Signal Processing<br>(_Aug 2017_)
`Verilog` `Cadence Virtuoso` `ModelSim` `Microwind`<br>
* This project was a part of my Academic Curricullum, BITS EEE-434 Digital Signal Processing.
* After the recording of voice implemented the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm on the signal received to determine the fundamental frequency.
* Observed the effect of noise on the fundamental frequency when white Gaussian noise is added to the recorded signal at a suitably low and high value of SNRs.<br>
* Review paper of project is presented in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/digvijay-bansal/Gender-Detection).
